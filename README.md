PROJECT DESCRIPTION<br>
<br>
THE GAME STARTS WITH TWO PLAYERS AS ACTIVE MEMBERS, HAVING A ONE-PRINT BOARD ON THE SCREEN WHICH DISPLAYES 9 BOXES(i.e., 3*3). THE FIRST PERSON WHO STARTS THE GAME HAS TO ENTER EITHER X OR O FOR ANY ONE BOX, FOLLOWED BY THE OTHER PLAYER ENTERING THE OTHER X OR O (OPPOSITE TO WHAT THE FIRST PLAYER HAS ENTERES). THIS CONTINUES UNLESS ANY ONE OF THEM GETS A LINE CUT EITHER DIAGONALLY OR STRAIGHT. AND THE PERSON WHO FOUNDS THE LINE IS THE WINNER OF THE GAME.
